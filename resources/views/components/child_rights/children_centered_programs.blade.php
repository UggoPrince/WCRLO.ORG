                <p>
                    Women for Civil Rights & Liberties Organization is a humanity driven non-governmental organization that are also believed in children access to basic education is Paramount. 
                    Every child in respective where they come from, where they live or poverty level of the family, must have the right to quality education. WCRLO has been supporting so many children in different ways so they can attend, learn and obtain basic education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Nigeria, 1 in every 10 children is out of school or have dropped out of school. Majority of them were sent out of private schools when their families due to poverty condition could not afford to pay their school fees. We have the record of 451 children that have stopped schooling because their guardians or parents do not have money to pay the fees.Parents and communities are urged to take education as the developmental process every child must obtained and they should enrol their children at the right age in quality learning in safe and protective school environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mostly, some of these disadvantaged children are living very far away from government owned schools and there are many cases of missing children who tried to attend the free public school, due the long distance. Some parents prefer a child to dropped out of school than facing the insecurity situation in Nigeria.
                    We have series of advocacy programs centered on education for every  child in Nigeria. The expected outcome of the programmes is that all  children to access and complete quality education, within a safe learning environment, gaining the skills and knowledge for life long learning
                    ....with educating & empowering the vulnerable - school children & women in less privileged rural areas and providing  preventive interventions to end gender based violence in all our communities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keeping children who have dropped out of school back to school is what WCRLO team have been doing over the years with the support of public donations. Thou getting the enough financial help to keep or sustain these less privillaged children in school is a big problem to us coupled with situations whereby some schools are not ready to give us time to source for funds to pay up their fees and there is little we can do to help every one of them without enough finance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we have more than 543 school children from 6- 17yrs in our list that we are sustaining in different schools in Nigeria and more than 100 of them that are still out of school but due to lack of funds, we are unable to sponsor them back to schools. Meanwhile,people are still bringing more cases daily to us.
                    There are many factors that hinder us from keeping all the children brought to our office for sponsorship e.g

                        We do raise funds through individuals contribution and social media crowd funding 
                        but what we do get is far cry from children that need school fees support. 
                        We do write to , corporate bodies, international communities & humanitarian 
                        Organization etc for support to enable us achieve the goal of ensuring every 
                        child attained and obtained basic education in Nigeria. But majority of them don't 
                        respond or even acknowledge our letter.

                        The education deprivation in Nigeria is driven by various factors like socio-cultural 
                        norms and practices that discourages attendance in formal education, 
                        especially for girls.

                        Apart from serious factors of parents living far away from Public schools and poverty 
                        state of some parents. Povery hinders some parents from sending their children to the 
                        school. When a family is striving to eat, education becomes less priority for them 
                        because they may afford to pay fees charged by private schools especially those 
                        living far from public schools. They may not also afford to pay transport fares 
                        from their homes to public.

                        Marginalization against female children is a common practice in some part of Nigeria. Parents will send their male chilldren to school while female chilldren will be left at home to do domestic chores or being forced to early marriage. Parents and communities are being sensitized about the girls education and ills of early marriages. This is a predominantly practises in Northern Nigeria.
                        Commonly in the Northern Nigeria, the females primary net attendance rates is 47.7 percent and 47.3 percent, respectively, meaning that more than half of the girls are not in school. .

                        The educational provision in predominantly rural areas and the impact of insurgency 
                        in the northeast also present significant challenges to children education in Nigeria.

                <p>
                    In north-eastern and north-western states, 29 percent and 35 percent of Muslim children, 
                    respectively, receive Qurâ€™anic education, which does not include basic skills such as 
                    iteracy and numeracy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In north-eastern Nigeria, 2.8 million children are in need of education-in-emergencies 
                    support in three conflict-affected States (Borno, Yobe, Adamawa). In these States, 
                    at least 802 schools remain closed and 497 classrooms are listed as destroyed, 
                    with another 1,392 damaged but repairable.

                    Basic education for every child is about building the future society of literate & 
                    civil minds, and giving every child the reading-writing skills to exploit maximum 
                    opportunities in their future.

                    You can support us by donating to our children education project themed - Keep every 
                    child in school Initiative which centered on sponsoring children from poor homes's 
                    education, bringing those ones that have dropped out of school due to poverty 
                    condition of their family or other reasons back to school.

                <p>
                    Child abuse or child maltreatment are categorised into:
                    <div class="text-site-orange">
                    <p class=" mt-0 pt-0"> Physical,<br>
                    Sexual abuse,<br>
                    Psychological and <br>
                    Neglect. </p>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Child abuse includes any act or failure to act by a parent or a caregiver that results 
                    in actual or potential harm to a child, and can occur in a child's home, or in 
                    the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with. All children have 
                    the right to be protected from violence, exploitation and abuse. Yet, millions of 
                    children worldwide from all socio-economic backgrounds, across all ages, religions 
                    and cultures suffer violence, exploitation and abuse every day. Millions more are at risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some girls and boys are particularly vulnerable because of gender, age, race, ethnic origin or socio-economic status. Higher levels of vulnerability are often associated with children with disabilities who are orphaned,
                    indigenous, from ethnic minorities and other marginalised groups. Other risks for children are associated with living and working on the streets and living in communities where inequality, unemployment and poverty are highly concentrated. 
                    Natural disasters, armed conflict, and displacements may expose children to additional risks.</p>
                <p>
                    Violence, exploitation and abuse are often practiced by someone known to the child, including parents, other family members, caretakers, teachers, customers (for children that hawks) and street children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is significant evidence that violence, exploitation and abuse can affect the childâ€™s physical and mental health in the short and longer term, impairing their ability to learn and socialize, and impacting their transition to adulthood with adverse consequences later in life.
                    In Nigeria, there are many cases of domestic violence or abuses against children in Nigeria. In Africa, there is this common belief that for a child to grow into responsible adult in future, every measure of beatings must be used
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often times, we do receive series report of abuses against children and we first investigate and prosecute the  perpetrators.
                    Violence, exploitation and abuse occur in the homes, families, schools, care and justice systems, workplaces and communities across all contexts, including as a result of conflict and natural disasters. Many children are exposed to various forms of violence, exploitation and abuse, including sexual abuse and exploitation, armed violence, trafficking, child labour, gender-based violence, bullying (see UNICEF, Too often in silence, 2010), cyber-bullying, gang violence, female genital mutilation/cutting, child marriage, physically and emotionally violent child discipline, and other harmful practices.
                    Our key role of helping the  needy children is to tackle poverty which does not lie in doling out benefits to them. We focused on equipping them with all the necessary tools (quality education, healthcare, safety and security, professional skills, etc.) so that they can attain personal economic growth and in turn contribute to their own, societyâ€™s and countryâ€™s growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are some ways in which WCRLO contribute their 
                    bit in fighting poverty among disadvantaged children in Nigeria:
                </p>
                <div class=" d-block bg-light p-3">
                    <ul>

                            Donating to the needy which includes taking food items, clothes, shoes and other 
                            necessities to the motherless/ orphanage homes  or Orphans, Widows, Physical 
                            Challenged children, Hearing impaired  children schools,Blind children schools, Home of Mentally retarded Children etc.
                            We focused our energies and resources in providing the above class of children (who are the future of tomorrow) the right tools that can pave way for them to march ahead in life. 
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3">
                            Our organisation has helped many deprived children to get a chance of healthy 
                            development from childhood to adulthood by promoting quality learning 
                            opportunities, good parental guidance, access to healthcare, protection 
                            from abuse and harm. Also  medical relief and rehabilitation during any 
                            disaster or distress and emergencies.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3">
                            We also ensured that marginalised children of Nigeria are given necessary tools & resources to grow up into mature, healthy and skilled adults who can earn a decent livelihood and leave behind the life of poverty.
                            However, most of our activities are reliant on donations. When you have the heart and the passion of mind to help people come out from the quagmire of poverty, what better thing to do than to equip them with the necessary tools and trainings that will make them to be more self- reliant and self independent. We put our limited resources to efficient use through conduction of social welfare projects for every child.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The little donation that comes to us are used to devise and execute 
                    projects which brings poor children under the purview of several benefits.
