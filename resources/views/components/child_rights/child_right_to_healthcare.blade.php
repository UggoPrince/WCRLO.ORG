                    Health is vitally important for every human being in the world. 
                    Health is the state of physical, mental and social well-being and does not only mean an absence of illness or disease.

                    The right to health is closely linked to other fundamental human rights, 
                    most notably access to potable 
                    water and adequate hygiene.<br>

                    All children have the right to timely access to appropriate health services. This 
                    requires the establishment of a system to protect health, including access to 
                    essential medicine.

                    The realization of the right to health implies that each country will put in 
                    place health services that are available in any circumstance, accessible to 
                    everyone, of good quality and satisfactory (meaning they conform to medical ethics 
                    and are respectful of our biological and cultural differences)

                    distinction between the right to health and the right to good health.
                    The right to health involves prevention and awareness campaigns.

                    Prevention plays an essential role in maintaining public health, particularly 
                    children’s health. Health education and vaccinations prevent the spread of infectious 
                    disease.

                    Vaccinations are efficient because they are fairly inexpensive and they 
                    protect children against the risk of death and handicaps caused by the most 
                    common children’s diseases (tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, leprosy, polio, 
                    whooping cough, measles.) In the long term, these vaccinations can even lead to 
                    the end of these diseases in a given country.

                    Vaccinating children, as well as awareness campaigns, can lead to a significant 
                    reduction in health risks. Additionally, spreading basic information about hygiene, 
                    nutritional needs, etc., as well as the circulation of simple illustrations 
                    reminding people of the fundamental rules are very efficient actions for informing 
                    populations and improving healthy behavior.<br>

                    For children, the right to health is vital because they are vulnerable beings, 
                    more at risk to illness and health complications. When children are spared from 
                    disease, they can grow into healthy adults, and in this way, contribute to the 
                    development of dynamic and productive societies.

                    Children require extra attention in order to enjoy the best possible health. This 
                    allows them to develop properly during their childhood and teenage years.

                    At every step of their physical and mental development, children have specific 
                    needs and different health risks. Additionally, a newborn is more vulnerable 
                    and more exposed to certain diseases than a young child or 
                    teenager (i.e. infectious disease, malnutrition.)

                    On the other hand, a teenager, due to his or her habits and behavior, are exposed 
                    to other kinds of risks (sexual health, mental health, alcohol and drug use etc.)

                    Generally, a child who benefits from appropriate health care will enjoy a 
                    better state of health during the stages of childhood and can become a 
                    healthy adult. WCRLO works with mothers and healthcare services in Nigeria 
                    to ensure that every child in Nigeria are given all the necessary 
                    healthcare. Every mother including pregnant women have access health care. Nigerian 
                    government, WHO & other international organizations are also doing their best in
                     making the healthcare more and easy accessible.
