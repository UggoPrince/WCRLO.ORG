                    CHILD'S  CIVIL RIGHTS, LIBERTIES & DEVELOPMENTS

                <p>
                    Children face the series of violations of their rights in Nigeria, 
                    including poverty, physical abuses, emotional tortures,  
                    and discrimination against them.
                    
                    These violations include child poverty, 
                    violence against children in all its forms as well as discrimination against girls, 
                    children born outside of wedlock, children with disabilities, 
                    orphans and less advantaged children.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    There are several ways and means to also help the children especially the 
                    disadvantaged ones, but nothing works better than making a contribution or 
                    dedication that will help the children and their families battle poverty.
