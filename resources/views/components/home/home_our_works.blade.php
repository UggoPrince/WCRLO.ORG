                <p>
                Our top mission is to help as many children as possible to a better life.

                Sadly, many children in Africa do not have that opportunity. On the streets, 
                children lose their rights to emotional, physical and social development. 
                They lack quality healthcare, sound education and positive uplifting recreation. 
                Without the security and comfort of a home, they are exposed to cruelty, abuse and 
                exploitation. Since 2015 Women for Civil Rights & Liberties Organization has been 
                working to help street children find home, obtain basic education, find hope and find a future.

                The WCRLO Team usually embarks on series of periodical Street Outreach across Nigeria in Africa. 
                The primary aim of doing this is to reach out to the homeless children of the 
                street and school drop outs about what we do and to see how we can extend our care; 
                shelter and protection services to them. During this outreach, we give support to these 
                children in form of individual and group psycho-social counseling and thereafter enroll 
                them to school in order to equip them with basic education.

                Those who have finished secondary school and want to pursue higher 
                education will be supported through financing of their education. 
                We organize Vocational training for those that want to be self employed. 
                Some are also rescued from the streets and taken to their various homes.
