                    There are children in every country in the world who are in need of resources to 
                    improve their daily lives which some families due to economic hardship in most 
                    of African countries. Millions of children  die each year from preventable causes. 
                    Hundreds of millions more suffer illnesses that prevent them from being healthy 
                    and attending school. While some are not attending school due to financial 
                    state of their guardians or parents. Lastly, many dies of hunger.

                    We focus on empowering these families with Vocational trainings or providing small capital for them to start a business inorder to tackle poverty that is the core problem. When such families are financial independent the children basic needs will be taken care of. 
                    According to the UN, 783 million people live on less than $1.90 per day. The overwhelming lack of sustainable jobs prevents individuals from rising out of poverty.
                    We hope and strive in our capacity to bring sustainable economic change that will create a world where families can provide everything their children need. It is a reality that many kids in Africa are struggling, suffering, and sometimes dying from not having key resources for their health, education, and more. When the family finance is sustained, it can help kids be more healthy, attend school more often, and be more confident. 
                    WCRLO team will continue to work with individuals, organizations, affected families,and their communities in bringing changes to many lives.
