                    WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN NIGERIA

                    Nigeria has a national gender policy that focuses on the empowerment of women and 
                    advocates against any form of discrimination against women, and the Nigerian 
                    Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. There has been 
                    improvement in terms of gender equality in education: Girls’ school enrollment 
                    has steadily increased, particularly in the north of the country, which in the 
                    past has seen a high rate of neglect and discrimination toward women. However, 
                    there is still significant gender disparity when it comes to labor force participation 
                    and representation in government. This can be attributed to cultural norms, 
                    discriminatory laws and other factors such as women’s child care and family commitments.

                    Women’s political participation has improved, but much still needs to be 
                    done. For instance, the Nigerian Senate voted down legislation—the Gender 
                    Parity and Prohibition of Violence Against Women bill—that aimed to give women 
                    equal rights in marriage, education and employment. Under the law, a widow in 
                    Nigeria would have automatically become the custodian of her children and 
                    husband’s property upon her husband’s death. While a few lawmakers supported 
                    the bill, others believed that it violated the spirit and letter of the 
                    Nigerian Constitution. If there was better representation of women in the 
                    Senate, the bill might have passed. 
                    The debate over the law was complicated by another bill that would have 
                    expanded Shariah law in Nigeria; that bill was rejected. The combination of a 
                    federal government and a tripartite system of civil, customary and religious 
                    law also makes it very difficult to harmonize legislation and remove 
                    discriminatory measures across Nigeria.

                    Gender equality in Nigeria is a big issue, but even with a lot published on the 
                    topic, it has not received significant attention by the government. Despite the 
                    ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
                    of Discrimination Against Women, women’s rights and gender equality are not getting 
                    the necessary attention required because of certain religious and cultural constraints 
                    that perpetuate gender inequality.

                    Unfortunately, the Nigerian Constitution, despite prohibiting gender-based 
                    discrimination, does not protect women’s rights. An ideal constitution would be 
                    drafted with the input of every segment of society, but the 1999 charter was made 
                    without consulting Nigeria’s women, and its language reflects this. For example, 
                    Section 26 of the Constitution says that a foreign woman married to a Nigerian 
                    man is eligible for Nigerian citizenship, but the same right is not granted to 
                    a foreign man married to a Nigerian woman. Section 131, which lists the qualifications 
                    for the office of the president, uses the word “he,” suggesting that only a man 
                    can be president. The Constitution generally uses the words “he,” “his” and “him,” 
                    and doesn’t include female pronouns.

                <p>
                    Adherence to Islamic and customary laws reinforces practices that are unfavorable 
                    to women, including those relating to freedom of movement, marriage and 
                    inheritance. Although a bill to abolish all forms of discrimination against 
                    Nigerian women was considered in the mid-2000s, the National Assembly did not 
                    pass it or related legislation prohibiting violence against women. There are 
                    social and political barriers stand in the way of women’s rights, and Nigerian 
                    government are yet to take bold steps to address violence against womenand gender inequality.

                    Gender discrimination is common in Nigeria because of the patriarchal nature of 
                    society. Women are marginalized both in their private and public life. At home, 
                    they are not considered equal partners when making decisions, even if they are 
                    expected to make substantial financial contributions to the household. Women are 
                    rarely considered for leadership positions of social institutions that include 
                    men. Political life in Nigeria is based on male norms and values, and men determine 
                    the standards for political participation and the rules that govern the electoral 
                    process, greatly limiting women’s participation in politics. This gender disparity 
                    is traceable to the perception that women are better subordinates, whose social rights 
                    and benefits should be subject to the dictates of men.
                    Women are also thought to be better caregivers, better suited to raise children and 
                    take care of the home, rather than hold social or political positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many Nigerians believe that men have more political will, courage, confidence and 
                    stamina to navigate politics than women. Women also have persistently low incomes 
                    thanks to the gender pay gap, occupational segregation and unpaid family care. As a 
                    result, they are far less likely than men to be in social and business networks that 
                    donate money to political campaigns. This means that women’s interests aren’t properly 
                    represented in local or national politics.

                    We as Nongovernmental organizations are working to advance women’s rights in 
                    Nigeria with some success. As advocacy group we have been championing the 
                    rights of women and campaigning against domestic violence, but a lot still needs to be done.
