                    Women’s rights are the fundamental human rights that were enshrined by the United Nations for every human being on the planet nearly 70 years ago. 
                    These rights include the right to live free from violence, slavery and discriminations; to be educated; to own property; to vote; and to earn a fair and equal wage.That is to say, women are entitled to all of these rights. 
                    Yet almost everywhere around the world, women and girls are still denied their full human rights, often simply because of their gender.

                    Winning rights for women is about more than giving opportunities to 
                    any individual woman or girl; it is also about changing how countries 
                    and communities treats women and children. It involves changing laws and 
                    policies, winning hearts and minds, and investing in women and girl child 
                    in order to bring out their full potentials.

                    including chilldren of both sex are giving their full rights and liberties in every 
                    area  of life. Also for women to own properties, vote, run for office, get or paid 
                    fair wages, and live free from violence – including domestic violence, sexual assault, 
                    and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, child marriage and so on and on.

                    In Nigeria, we want every woman and girl child to realize their rights that are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We also stand for other rights that are vital for gender’s equality. 
                    We stand for a woman’s right to decide if and when she to have children, and to have high-quality health care that means she won’t die in pregnancy or during childbirth. 
                    We stand strongly against female genital mutilation as violation of girl's right and which must be abolished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And we stand for the rights of every woman to live equally and free from discrimination, no matter her sexuality or identity. 
                    We follows and operates within two critical women’s rights according to UN declaration-The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), an international bill of rights for women whuch requires governments to end gender discrimination and affirms women’s rights to health services, including family planning. 
                    The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, adopted in 1995 at the UN’s Fourth World Conference in Beijing, a rallying cry to embed gender equality and women’s rights in every facet of life.

                    Nigeria cannot continue to underestimate the role women plays in advancing our national interests and our country’s goals of peace, stability, and prosperity. They tend to underplay that what makes us diverse, makes us strong and no Nation can get ahead if about half their populations are left behind. 
                    If Nigeria truly supports the Sustainable Development Goals, then women should have all their full civil rights  and liberties in every areas of life 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For both women’s and men’s needs and priorities to be addressed adequately in society, both must be involved and represented in the decision-making process, in policy creation and its implementation, inclusive of economic & security sectors as well.
                    Women for Civil Rights & Liberties Organization (WCRLO) also centered their humanitarian focus on child rights including their liberties, safety, interests,educational and economic developments.
                    Despite great strides made by the international women’s rights movement over many years, women and girls around the world are still married as children or trafficked into forced labor and sex slavery. They are refused access to education and political participation, and some are trapped in conflicts where rape is perpetrated. Around the world, deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth are needlessly high, and women are prevented from making deeply personal choices in their private lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Infact many human rights organization around the world are seriously working toward the realization of women’s empowerment and gender equality—protecting the rights and improving the lives of women and girls on the ground.
