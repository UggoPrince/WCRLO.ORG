                    Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation, and it is 
                    perhaps the most pervasive. It knows no boundaries of geography, culture or wealth. 
                    As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be making real progress towards equality, 
                    development and peace- KOFI ANNAN (FORMER UN SECRETARY GENERAL)<br>
                    We project, promote the rights of every female also strongly fight for any violence against any woman in Africa.
